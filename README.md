# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM Neural Networks

<h1> Overview</h1>
This project focuses on predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequential data such as time series. The LSTM model is trained on historical stock price data of Google (ticker symbol 'GOOG') spanning from January 2010 to December 2022. The trained model is then used to forecast stock prices for the year 2023.
